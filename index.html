        <h2 style="text-align:center ;">I'm SORRY </h2>
        <p>
            On a Thursday night on the phone at 10:17, I broke up
 with my ex for incomprehensible reasons.7 weeks and
 a few days later, a beautiful young adult with the skin
 clear and polished;  looking fresh and rested;  pleasant face and
 full;  the breasts have a slightly exaggerated roundness;  photocopying
 of her buttocks in her pants and in her skirts;  etc... who,
 about 12 years at most than me, enough penny, wants to make me
 believe what she wishes with me.  The young lady charms me with
 small-big gifts almost daily.  So she is
 became my girl without hesitation.  Did I love him for love, or for
 its offers?
        </p>
        <p>
            I fascinated her as if I bewitched her;  we share our noble feelings, as if we were made for each other;  she gives me almost everything.
            My ex calls me, 2 years later, she wants to go back on the road with me. As I loved her, I love her and I would always love her, I take the risk of starting again with her. For a while, I have both at the same time. Why didn't I choose one or the other, but I accept both? Have I loved, with all my soul, the lady or love, for her, is indifferent? 
        </p> Surprisingly, the lady had put something on the phone that she had offered me. She can see all the calls, incoming and outgoing SMS, I got grilled. She reproaches my ingratitude; it degrades me through social networks; she said everything to the miss, and she breaks up, with me, again.
        <p>
            The lady informs me that she will come back to recover all the wonderful machines she has offered me, such as: the car; jewellery; and even the clothes that are on me. Did she react well, didn't she have other ways to let me down or did I deserve this fate? I have only one sentence in mind for both of them: "I AM SINCERELY SORRY".

        <h2 style="text-align:center ;">Hopeless</h2>
        <p>
            I had a strong attraction for a girl named Laeticia. She is a girl I loved so much, I admired her, I contemplated her. She is tangibly wonderful, a natural lump, in her chest, an organ, seduction, even located at the anterior part of the chest, her cadenced and classic gait, her bulging buttocks attract ... Always saying. 
            I made a wish, that I would do my best to possess it, and that the impossible will be possible, but I was still in school. This young lady loves luxury, appearance, wealthy young people. I don't work, so where am I going to find money, how am I going to offer her everything she wants? Since I'm not the kind of guy she's looking for, she pushed me away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strange coincidence, Laeticia walked around, and auditioned the way my mother blamed me, treated me like a little thief. When we meet, a few kilometers from his house, she tells me that she does not have friends who are thieves, and not to talk with her anymore.
